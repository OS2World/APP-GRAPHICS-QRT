        The QRT ray  tracer  is  designed  to  run  on  any computer with
        sufficient  graphics  capabilities.   The  machine  should have a
        resolution of at least 128K  dots/screen,  and be able to display
        color graphics.  At least 256 simultaneous  colors are needed for
        acceptable  images;  however,  it  may  be  possible  to  display
        rudimentary images with as little as 64 colors.
        
        The QRT program itself is the same across computers; only the QRT
        post processor differs.  QRT computes the image internally with a
        much higher color resolution than most computers have (16 million
        simultaneous colors), and the  post  processor maps this image to
        the  available  palette.  This  document  describes  the  machine
        dependent details of the post processor.
        
        On most computers the following naming convention is recommended:

        Commodore Amiga
           
           QRT was designed and written  on  the Commodore Amiga.  Unlike
           many machines, the Amiga  has  a  very  standard graphics file
           format which nearly any graphics  program can read.  Two steps
           are necessary to transform the QRT output file to the graphics
           file format (IFF/HAM).  First, the  QRT post processor is run.
           Second,  a  separate   program   (RAY2)  compresses  the  post
           processor output into  IFF  file  format  for viewing with any
           "iff-show" type program.
           
           QRT can be run in the  background  on the Amiga.  It should be
           run  with a low task priority  so  that  it will not interfere
           with normal operation of the computer.   At least one megabyte
           is recommended, and the QRT  output  file  should be sent to a
           RAM disk or hard drive.  It is possible to send it to a floppy
           disk, but  the  disk  will  constantly  be  accessed  for  the
           duration of the  image  creation  time.   It  will probably be
           necessary to increase the default  process stack size with the
           STACK command.  A stack size of  40K or more is recommended to
           avoid stack overflow errors;  however,  some images require as
           much as 80k of stack space.

        Data General MV10000
           
           The Data General DG1000 terminal  has a high display and color
           resolution, so the resulting  QRT  output  file is large.  QRT
           should  be  run  in  the  background  on  this  machine.   The
           resulting picture file may be displayed  with the DISP program
           (G. Radack).
           
           Although the Data General is capable of a resolution of 1280 x
           1024, there have  been  problems  allocating  this much memory
           with the DISP program.  Therefore,  the DG version of QRT will
           not use the entire display.  The  largest possible bitmap file
           size has not yet been determined.

        IBM PC or AT with EGA Graphics
           
           The IBM is capable of a  relatively  high  display resolution,
           although the color palette is quite limited.  The machine does
           not permit background tasks,  so  the ray tracer should be run
           when the machine may be left unoccupied  for a long time.  The
           output should be sent to a hard disk or extended memory drive.
           
           The IBM version  of  QRTPost  is  not  yet  complete as of the
           writing of this document.  The  QRT  program itself is working
           on the IBM, but it should be run  on an IBM with at least an 8
           mHz 80286 and floating point co-processor. (Otherwise, it will
           take nearly forever).  A 386 would be better yet.

        Hewlett Packard 9000 Series
           
           The HP 9000's are a series of technical workstations with high
           resolution (up to 1280x1024) display resolution.  They come in
           two   architectures:    Motorola   680x0   or   HP   Precision
           Architecture.
           
           QRT has been tested on the following machine types:
           
              320 - (16 mhz 68020 + 68881)
              360 - (25 mhz 68020 + 68881)
              370 - (33 mhz 68030 + 68882)
           
              835 - (HP Precision Architecture)
           
           (The 835 is *fast* - it can run  320 x 400 images in less than
           3 and a half minutes for most  images,  and  less than 1 and a
           half for simple ones, where it takes my poor 68000 based Amiga
           4 hours,   and  30  minutes,  respectively).   The  370  is no
           slowpoke  either.

        Macintosh II
           
           I've never seen Mac II  generated  QRT images, but they should
           look quite nice  (640x480x256  colors).   There  may  be a few
           problems compiling QRT on  the  Mac  II  given the non-command
           line operating system.
