           Pattern Resizing
               
               Patterns can now be resized.  If a pattern is defined with
               a size of 10 x 10, it  can  be  made  bigger or smaller on
               each object to which it is  attached.   This capability is
               not listed in the Language Reference Guide.
               
               Anywhere the keyword  PATTERN  appears  within a primitive
               definition, two other parameters can be attached:
               
                    xmult = p
                    ymult = p
               
               where p is a positive  floating  point  number.  This is a
               scale factor; for  example,  '2'  would  make  the pattern
               twice as big, and   '.25'  would  reduce it by a factor of
               4.  The x and y sizing parameters need not be the same.
               
               
        Bugs in Version 1.1
        
           Transparent Objects
           
               Object transparency  does  not  work  correctly in version
               1.1.  This bug is localized to a small section of code and
               will be fixed in a future version.   QRT still accepts the
               TRANS parameter, but it should not be used.
