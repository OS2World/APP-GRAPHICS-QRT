        The following are changes to QRT made since version 1.1
        
        Additions and Enhancements
        
           Polygon Primitive Added to Pattern Command
               
               Patterns in version 1.1 could  include only rectangles and
               circles;  a  new  polygon  command  vastly  increases  the
               utility of the  pattern  command.   Polygons  may have any
               number of points (at least  three),  but a large number of
               points will increase the time 
               taken for the  containment  test,  and  hence  the time to
               complete the image.  A fast containment algorithm is used,
               but it is still linear  in  the  number  of  points in the
               polygon.  A practical limit 
               might be 30 to 40 points (split  among all polygons in the
               pattern).
               
               In order for the polygon command to operate correctly, the
               first point must be the same as the last point.  ex:
               
                     PATTERN ( name    = TRIANGLE_TEST
                               x_size  = 6
                               y_size  = 6
               
                               POLYGON (
                                 POINT = (0 , 0)
                                 POINT = (5 , 0)
                                 POINT = (2.5,5)
                                 POINT = (0 , 0)  { same as 1st pt }
               
                                 { ** any number of additional points
                                      could be added here ** }
                               )
               
                               { ** more polygons or other pattern
                                    primitives could come here     ** }
                             )
               
               Polygon primitives may be  mixed  in a pattern with either
               circles or rectangles.   If  a  rectangle  is desired, the
               rectangle primitive is faster than a four point polygon.

        Bug Report
        
           One bug found in version 1.1  has  been  fixed.  The shadowing
           routine in version 1.1  did  not  operate  quite correctly:  a
           point was  (incorrectly)  computed  as  being in a shadow if a
           line drawn from the point to  the  lamp  intersected an object
           even on the other side  of  the  lamp.   The  test should have
           looked at objects only on  the  same  side  of the lamp as the
           point in question.  This  was giving  extra shadows in strange
           places, and has been fixed in this version.
           
           
        Planned Extensions for 1.3
        
           Version 1.3 will probably  include  a  better lexical analyser
           that can cope  with  nested  comments  and  possibly  #include
           files.  The  #include  directive  would  enable one to amass a
           file of often  used  patterns,  for  example.   The  parser is
           plenty fast enough (between 2  and  3 hundred lines per second
           from RAM:) to make this practical.
           
           
        Hints, Tips, etc.
        
           Try using a general purpose macro processor to pre-process QRT
           input. #define BRICK_RED  (.8,  .2,  .1),  for example, or use
           parameter macros to  #define  CYLINDER  (height,  diameter) to
           eliminate the need for  entering  quadratic  coefficients.  (I
           may add CYLINDER, CONE,  and  SPHEREOID  commands  to a future
           version of QRT.   They  would  simply  map  into  the  current
           quadratic primitive, but make QRT easier to use).
