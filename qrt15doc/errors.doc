        Illegal Parameter
           
           This error code no longer used.  See Undefined Parameter.
           
           
        Too Few Parameters
           
           All the required parameters  were  not specified.  See the QRT
           Language  Reference Guide for a list of required parameters to
           this command.  This error  message  also  appears if a command
           line option with no argument is passed to QRT.
           
           
        Illegal Object Type
           
           QRT does not understand this primitive type.
           
           
        Malloc Failure
           
           QRT was unable to allocate  enough  memory.  Either reduce the
           object tree size, or run QRT on a machine with more memory.
           
           
        Syntax Error
           
           Improper QRT syntax, such  as  a  BEGIN_BBOX  with no matching
           END_BBOX.
           
           
        Internal Error
           
           (May  be 'Programmer Confusion Error'  on some versions). This
           error should never occur.  If  it  does,  either there is some
           illegal value not caught  during  input parsing, or there is a
           programming error in the QRT system.
           
           
        File Error
           
           QRT couldn't open or close  the  output  file.  Check that the
           file name adheres  to  the  naming  convention  used  for your
           computer.

        Pattern not found
           
           A pattern was attached to a  primitive,  but  this pattern was
           never defined.
           
           
        Pattern already defined
           
           Two patterns were defined with the same name.
           
           
        No observer defined
           
           No observer was defined to QRT.
           
           
        Undefined parameter
           
           QRT does not recognize this parameter  type.  Either it is not
           legal, or not legal in this context.
           
           
        World contains non-homogeneous object
           
           Error code not supported by this version of QRT.
           
           
        An index of refraction is 0
           
           An object that is transparent has an index of refraction equal
           to zero.
           
           
        Illegal color_info value
           
           An object surface characteristic  was defined improperly. Most
           take values in the range 0.00 to 1.00.
           
           
        Parameter should be >= 0
           
           This parameter only takes values greater than zero, but it was
           given a value less than zero.
           
           
        Zero multiplier
           
           A pattern size multiplier is zero.  Use only positive values.

        Undefined name
           
           An INSTANCE_OF primitive attempted  to use a name that was not
           defined in the instance definition tree.
           
           
        Left paren expected
           
           There should be a left parenthesis on this line.
           
           
        Right paren expected
           
           There should be a right parenthesis on this line.
           
           
        Illegal vector structure
           
           A  position  or  direction  vector  of  the  form  (x,y,z) was
           specified improperly.
           
           
        Illegal color triple
           
           A color triple of the form (r,g,b) was specified improperly.
           
           
        Illegal command line argument
           An illegal  command  line  option  was  specified.   The legal
           command line options are:  -xres, -yres, -aspect, and -foclen.
           The first two take integer arguments; the others take floating
           point arguments.
