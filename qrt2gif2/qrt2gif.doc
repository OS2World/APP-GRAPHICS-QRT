What is it:
        This program is used to convert the output of the
        Quick Ray Trace (QRT) program and convert it to a file
        meeting the Graphics Interchange Format (GIF)
        standard.

        This program is intended to run on IBM compatible
        computers.

How to use it:
        After getting an output from QRT simply type:
        QRT2GIF inputfile outputfile [options]

        inputfile is the COMPLETE name (with path and
        extention) of the file created by QRT.

        outputfile is the COMPLETE name (with path and
        extention) for the GIF file output

        options are switches that are explained in the
        advanced section below.

        An example: QRT2GIF FILE.RAW FILE.GIF

        The GIF created will be up to 256 colors and the
        same resolution as that created by QRT.

Advanced options:
        The default method of operating is for the program
        to find the most colors it can (up to 256) and then
        attempt to "brighten" the picture up as much as
        possible.  Two switches allow you to alter these
        defaults.

        -cNNN  is the maximum number of colors to try for
        you can specify any number you wish here and the
        program will create a picture with no more than that
        number of colors (it will go lower if the picture
        does not have that many colors in it).  The GIF
        standard requires the number of colors be a binary
        value but this program will only fill in the number
        of places you specify and will then create a GIF
        with the other places blank.

        Example: QRT2GIF FILE.RAW FILE.GIF -C129
                Creates a GIF w/256 palette options but only
                the first 129 will be filled in.

        -sN is the maximum amount to brighten the picture by
        on post processing (in bits).

        The file that is created by QRT contains values for
        24 bits of color.  When we convert this to the 18
        bits of VGA data it tends to be a little dim.  To
        brighten things up QRT2GIF shifts all the values as
        much as possible to their brightest values. If you
        wish to limit this increase then you can lower the
        amount of the shift by adding the -s command.
        -s8  (default) causes the value to be shifted to its
        brightest value possible. -s0 causes it not be be
        shifted at all.  Usually the value is only shifted
        by 2 or 3 in operation.

        QRT2GIF FILE.RAW FILE.GIF -S0
                Causes the picture to be created without any
                color brightening.

        - mNNNN adjust maximum table size for the GIF.  This
        is used as a speed up for the GIF the lower the
        value the faster the GIF conversion will be but less
        compression that will occur.

        - qNNNN alternate adjustment of the table size of
        the GIF. This method is similar to the -m but it
        will work a LOT faster. The problems are documented
        below under caveats.

What it is doing:
         QRT2GIF uses two passes over the data.  The first
         pass creates a Palette table for the GIF.  It
         attempts to create the maximum number of colors
         possible but if too many colors exist then the
         resolution of the table is lowered until the entire
         picture is calculated.

        The second pass creates the actual GIF by doing the
        compression.

        On a 10MHZ 1 wait state machine it will require
        about 8-10 min. to create a GIF (This is of course is
        based upon the resolution of the input file). If you
        use the -q option (try -q1000) it will reduce to 2-4
        min. range.

Some Caveats:
        The GIF standard does not say that the method I use
        for the -Q is legal (it also does not exactly
        prohibit it) and I have not had any problems with
        any GIF viewer program I have tried.  But if you get
        some strange results you might not want to use the
        -Q option instead use the -M option for speed ups.

        As I feel sorry for some sysops, if you make a great
        GIF with this program please DO NOT use the -q or -m
        options (give them as small a GIF as possible).

The Bottom Line:
            As this is a limited use program all I ask for in
            support is that you don't distribute or sell it
            without my permission.  If you have any bug
            reports or problems or suggestions you can
            contact me on the above accounts. The preferred
            contact is via Prodigy since I can check in more
            frequently there without charge.


History:

V1.0
        Initial release

V1.1
        Fixed problems with some viewer programs (now
        creates completely normal GIFs.  (Note for other
        developers some programs get real picky about having
        an EOI on the end of the GIF).

        Enhanced palette table calculation (now creates more
        accurate color rendention)

        Updated encoder routine to use maximum string table
        for maximum compressed GIFs

        added -m and -q options to compensate for slowness
        of GIF encoder algorithm (I guess I will have to
        code it in assembly for more speed next time).
